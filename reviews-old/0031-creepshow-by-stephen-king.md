_Creepshow_ is a comic book adaptaion of the film of the same name. Illustrated by Bernie Wrightson, the book, like the film,  is a homage to the EC Comics publications of the 50s.

There are five stores:

### Father's Day

The first story sees the patriarch of a disfunctional, money-grubbing family rise from the grave to avenge his murder at the hands of his daughter. It's a little dialog-heavy for a visual format, but it does a good job setting the tone for the rest of the stories.

### The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill

The second story follows Jordy Verrill, a country yokel who discovers a small meteorite in his yard. Jordy, of course, messess with the smouldering rock and it cracks open, splashing him with a glowing green substance.  Soon Jordy's covered in a strange alien moss. The itching is unbearable. Somehow, he knows a bath will releave the irritation, but his last shred of good sense manifests in the form of the ghost of his dead father, who warns him that whatever's growing on him needs water to survive. Jordy takes the bath anyway. By the next moring Jordy and his farm are covered in the alien vegitation. Jordy commits suicide even as we see the weather forecast of heavy rains. 

This is an adaptation of the uncollected short story "Weeds," by King.

### The Crate

The third story, like the first is a little talky for a visual medium. While it played well in the movie, comic adaptation is a bit stiff. 

The plot concerns a college professor, Dexter Stanley who finds a crate in the college basement that seems to have been forgotten about some hundred and fifty years prior. Inside is a ferocious creature that kills a janitor and grad student before 
Dexter flees for help.

Dexter turns to his friend, fellow professor Henry Northrup. Northrup sees an opportuntiy to rid himself of his abusive, cheating wife. The creature obliges.

### Something to Tide You Over

The forth story is the best of the bunch. A wealthy man, Richard Vickers, discovers his wife has been cheating on him and concocts a terrible revenge. Outside his isolated beach house, Vickers buries his wife's lover up to his neck just outside the incoming surf. The tide is coming in will push up well past the man's head. How long can you hold your breath?, asks Vickers.

Making things even more ghastly, Vickers hauls out a small television on which he plays back footage of his wife meeting her end in a similar manner. 

Vickers retires to his beach house to watch the proceedings via closed-circuit television. 

Later, he returns to recover the bodies but they're nowhere to be found. Telling himself that the tide must have taken them, he returns home. 

Later that night, the two lovers return as undead monsters covered in seaweed. Vickers tries to shoot them, but as they say, "You can't kill someone if they're already dead!"


### They're Creeping Up on You!

The final story is the only one that actually plays better as a comic. The plot concerns a Howard Hughes-esque businessman named Upson Pratt. As thunderstorms bummet<?> the city, Pratt notices the impossible in his meticulously maintained fortress-like apartment penthouse. Roaches. He sprays and swears that someone will lose thier job for the idignity. But even as Pratt orchestrates a rutheless hostile takeover via a conference call, we see more roaches. Soon the thunderstorm triggers a rolling blackout and the roaches appear en mass. They swarm him, covering him, spilling into his mouth, down his throat. Come morning there isn't a roach in sight, just Pratt's bloated corpse. Then Pratt's lips begin to move. And out comes a roach.

While King isn't a master of the medium, his stories certainly capture the spirit of the old horror comics. Fans of those books will enjoy _Creepshow_ but for more casual King fans, the movie is probably a better choice.
