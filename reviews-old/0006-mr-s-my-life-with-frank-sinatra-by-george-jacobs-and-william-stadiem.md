Jacobs offers an insiders point of view into Sinatra's life beginning just before his comeback performance in From Here to Eternity and ending in the aftermath of his troubled marriage to Mia Farrow. While certainly salacious, the love Jacob's harbors for Mr. S. is evident, resulting in a raconteur tale that may not be the gospel truth, but is one hell of an enjoyable read.
