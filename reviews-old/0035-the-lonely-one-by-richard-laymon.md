Doreen is alone on the Merry Go Round at the Santa Monica pier. A handsome young man, Ron takes an interest. Doreen tries to dissuade him, saying anyone who gets close to her ends up dead. Ron doesn't listen. They venture in the carnival games and Doreen ditches Ron, running to hide under the pier. In the darkness, a vagrant assults her. Ron comes to her aid, only to find that the man under the pier is the least of his problems.

decent setup. nice foreshadowing (food, the wound healing, the necklace.)
