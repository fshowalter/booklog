After losing a teaching job due to his violent temper, once-promising writer (and recovering alcoholic) Jack Torrence uproots his wife Wendy and son Danny to Colorado, where they'll serve as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel.

The hotel was once a premier destination haunted by a malevolent presence bent on claiming Danny for its own ends.

King uses the hotel's supernatural presence and Danny's burgeoning telepathy to explore the nature of addiction from the perspective of the addicted and afflicted. Though the finale is somewhat confusing, knowing what we know now about King's battles with alcoholism and addiction, it's impossible not to read this as a painfully honest confession of an alcoholic parent.

It’s hard to read _The Shining_ and not see Jack Nicholson. That's how popular Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation has become. New readers will likely be surprised that the Jack in the novel never utters the famous “Here’s Johnny!” line.

The movie and book both share a similar plot. Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He moves in with his wife and five-year-old son just as the last of the hotel staff are leaving for the off-season. Soon, the snow comes, blocking the roads and isolating the hotel. Cut off from the outside world, Jack goes crazy and turns against his family in a murderous rage.

Where the book and film differ is in their presentation of the supernatural. King makes it clear that a malevolent presence haunts the hotel. This evil force wants Jack’s son Danny for it’s own ends. King never makes it clear why, but it's something to do with Danny's burgeoning telepathy. Kubrick’s film invites us to consider that the supernatural elements are all in the character’s minds.

They’re both entertaining stories, but Kubrick’s version is the more insightful. Because Kubrick saw what it took King years to see; that in Jack Torrance, Stephen King was writing himself.

Consider the character of Jack Torrance. Jack is a broke, alcoholic playwright struggling to live up to his early successes and provide for his family.

Now consider Stephen King when he was writing _The Shining_.  King was in the throes of alcoholism. His first two novels had been wildly successful. But it wasn’t that long ago that King worked as a high school teacher and struggled to afford medicine for his infant child. Sure, there was money in the bank now, but what if none of his other books sold? What if, like Jack, he stopped being able to write?

King writes Jack as a victim of the hotel's evil influence. Kubrick sees Jack as a monster and the story's supernatural elements as a way for Jack to deflect responsibility. Knowing this, is it any wonder that King hated Kubrick’s version?
