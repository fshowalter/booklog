It’s hard to read _The Shining_ and not see Jack Nicholson. Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation is so engrained in popular culture that new readers will likely be surprised that the Jack in the novel never utters the famous “Here’s Johnny!” line. 

The movie and book both share a similar plot. Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He moves in with his wife and five-year-old son just as the last of the hotel staff are leaving for the off-season. Soon, the snow comes, blocking the roads and isolating the hotel. Cut off from the outside world, Jack goes crazy and turns on his family in a murderous rage.

Where the book and the film differ is in their presentation of the supernatural. King makes it clear that the hotel is haunted by a malevolent presence bent on claiming Jack’s son Danny for it’s own ends. Kubrick’s film invites us to consider that its supernatural elements are all in the character’s minds and that Jack simply cracks up.

They’re both entertaining stories, but Kubrick’s version is the more insightful. Because Kubrick saw what it took King years to see; that in Jack Torrance, Stephen King was writing himself.

Consider Jack Torrance: a broke, alcoholic playwright struggling to live up to his early successes and provide for his family. 
Now consider King: an alcoholic novelist with two young children to support. His first two novels were wildly successful, but it wasn’t that long ago that he was a high school teacher writing in the laundry room of the doublewide trailer his family called home while trying to scrape together enough money to buy medicine for his infant child.

Knowing this, is it any wonder that King hated Kubrick’s version? For Kubrick, the supernatural elements of the story were just a way for Jack to deflect responsibility away from himself. For an addict like King, this likely hit a little too close to home.






King struggled with alcoholism while writing _The Shining_.  He also had two young children at the time. Knowing that, is it a stretch to read this as a confession of an alcoholic parent? Perhaps. But it's no less effective.

Consider that Jack is a writer struggling to live up to his early promise. _The Shining_ was King’s third book after the wildly successful _Carrie_ and _’Salems Lost_. 

The Torrance’s are hurting financially. We know that King wrote _Carrie_ at night in the laundry room of the trailer he was living in with his wife and first child while struggling to make ends meet. Lastly, Jack is an alcoholic and we now know that King struggled with alcoholism until the late 1980s. 

King struggled with alcoholism while writing _The Shining_.  He also had two young children at the time. Knowing that, is it a stretch to read this as a confession of an alcoholic parent? Perhaps. But it's no less effective.


_The Shining_ works because we sympathize with Jack. King writes him not as a bad man, but a flawed one. Jack is an alcoholic who hasn’t had a drink in five months. Jack has a bear of a temper. He lost his teaching job back in Vermont after his assaulting one of the students. He struggles to provide for his family. He struggles not to drink. He worries that he’s no better than his own drunken, abusive old man. 

But the book’s strength is that we see these things through the eyes of a five-year-old boy.  We feel Danny’s confusion and fear as Jack succumbs to his inner demons and becomes a monster. For a young child, or the child in each of us, could anything be more terrifying?





When they arrive, Danny senses something evil in the hotel. He wants to tell his parents but he also senses that his father needs this job and doesn't want to spoil things. As winter unfolds and the snow moves in, Danny begins having visions of the more gruesome events in the hotel's past.

In _The Shining_, Jack Torrance agrees to serve as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. Unbeknownst to Jack and his wife, their five-year-old son Danny is a burgeoning psychic. 

He moves in with his wife and five-year-old son Danny.


_The Shining_ is a haunted house story. The house in this case happens to be a hotel. It’s suitably menacing. Bad things happen there. You wouldn’t want to visit.

Jack Torrance is a once-promising writer who accepts a job as winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. 

Never mind that, during the winter months, the heavy snowfall cuts the Overlook off from the outside world for weeks or even months at a time. Jack thinks the isolation will allow him to focus on his writing. 

Never mind that it means uprooting his wife and five-year-old son across the country to the Colorado Rockies, the Torrance’s are broke and Jack has burned a lot of bridges. 

Never mind that the previous caretaker went mad and killed his family before committing suicide, Jack lost his teaching job at a Vermont prep school after assaulting a student. 

Jack and his wife don't know it, but their son Danny is a burgeoning telepath. When they arrive, Danny senses something evil in the hotel. He wants to tell his parents but he also senses that his father needs this job and doesn't want to spoil things. As winter unfolds and the snow moves in, Danny begins having visions of the more gruesome events in the hotel's past. 

The Overlook wants Danny for his psychic abilities, but Danny proves resistant to the hotel's influence. So the hotel goes to work on Jack. Bit by bit, the Overlook breaks him down until it possesses him completely, turning him against his family in a murderous rage.
