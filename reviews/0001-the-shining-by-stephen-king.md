Jack Torrence is a a once-promising writer and recovering alcoholic. Desperate for work after losing his teaching job in New England, Jack uproots his wife Wendy and son Danny to Colorado. There, they'll serve as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. 

The Overlook is a large, isolated hotel with a storied history, including several deaths. It's also home to a malevolent presence bent on claiming Danny for its own ends. But Danny proves to be resistant to the hotel's influence so it goes to work on Jack. 

The hotel plagues him with wasps wounding him. It blocks his writing, frustrating him. It dredges up memories of his abusive father, making him question his own parenting abilities. Bit by bit, the hotel wears him down, all the while planting the seed that things would all be better if Wendy and Danny were dead...

Though the finale is somewhat confusing, it's a well-executed haunted house tale.

King uses the story to explore the nature of addiction. In Jack he gives voice the the addicted. Through Jack we struggle to overcome our own dark nature. Jack's not a bad man, just a flawed one, made so by his abusive father. 

In Jack's burgeoning telepathic son Danny, King gives voice to the afflicted. Through Danny, we watch Jack succumb to his inner demons. We feel Danny's confusion and sorrow, his powerlessness and fear at watching his daddy become a monster.

King was struggling with alcoholism and had two young children when he wrote _The Shining_. Knowing that, it's impossible not to read this as an honest confession of an alcoholic parent.
