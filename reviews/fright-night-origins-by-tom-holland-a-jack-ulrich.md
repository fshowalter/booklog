Tom Holland, director and screenwriter of the original Fright Night film, partners with A. Jack Ulrich to craft an expanded novelization of the film, expanding the backstory and setting up an expanded universe and sequel.

Like the movie, the novel focuses on teenager Charlie Brewester who discovers his new suave next-door neighbor Jerry Dandridge is a vampire and recruits aging creature-feature host Peter Vincent for help.

Unlike the film, the novel transplants the action from Iowa to Rancho Corvallis, a small California town near Sonoma, and proffers additional scenes and an expanded backstory for Dandrige, real name Gellert cel Catura, and his servant, Billy, real name Wilhelm.

We even get details about Charlie's absent father. He'd been an auto mechanic, a trade he learned in the Army. He died from injuries susainted saving a woman and her daughter from a burning car.

The result proves uneven.

I enjoyed the added scenes chronicaling the police investigation into the rash of murders following Dandridge's arrival. It lends a procdedural angle absent in the film, and proffers one of the book's best self-deprecating moments during an exchange between cops trying to source what happened in the nightclub between Charlie and Dandridge:

> “What do you have?” Dent asked.
>
> “Not a lot. Initial interviews are sketchy, but this is what I’ve pieced together.  A well-dressed man in his thirties, dark hair, intense eyes, was dancing with a girl, a bit on the young side.  Some kid rolled up and took a swing at our well-dressed man and he caught the punch mid-swing,” Gonzales paused.
>
> “Bullshit,” Det. Deshawn managed.
>
> “I’ve seen it, once or twice, an amateur swinging on a pro, but yeah, it’s rare outside the movies,” Gonzales said. “But that’s what the witnesses say happened.”

Another great in-jokes comes when Peter Vincent bemaons how "even a stupid red-haired doll was more commercially viable than vampires..."

But Dandridge's added backstory--like most villian backstories--robs him of mystery and edge. Likewise, the backstory for Charlie's father helps explain his motivation for standing up to Dandrige, but as the film shows, proves unecessary.

Worst of all, the writing teems with lazy sentences that tell instead of show. Consider:

> Suddenly, the huge shadow of what might be a flying creature, a bat perhaps, was seen through his window. If only he were awake to see it, but he wasn’t.

Or the averb-rich:

> Peter stared at him and saw he was totally sincere, which meant the teen was crazy, certifiably insane.

And some chapters show signs of lazy editing. Chapter 57 opens with:

> Peter smashed through the front door into the Brewster house after having just escaped Jerry and his ghoul, Billy Cole, on the stairway in their house.

Which recaps the prior chapter's last sentence, reeking of some bad outline splicing.

All that said, for Fright Night fans, the audio book makes it worthwhile. Chris Sarandon, who played Dandridge in the film, narrates, and the thrill of hearing him read the story overshadows the novel's faults. This despite the glaring reddubs in the narration where, for a sentence or two, Sarandon seems to be speaking from an echo chamber, evidence said redubs were recorded in a different location or with different equipment.

Dissappointing, yes, but nothing Fright Night fans can't overcome.
