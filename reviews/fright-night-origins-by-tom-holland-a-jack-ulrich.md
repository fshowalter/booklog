Tom Holland, director and screenwriter of the original Fright Night film, partners with A. Jack Ulrich to craft an expanded novelization of the film, expanding the backstory and setting up an expanded universe and sequel.

Like the movie, the novel focuses on teenager Charlie Brewester who discovers his new suave next-door neighbor Jerry Dandridge is a vampire and recruits aging creature-feature host Peter Vincent for help.

Unlike the film, the novel transplants the action from Iowa to Northern California, and proffers additional scenes and an expanded backstory for Dandrige.

The result proves uneven. While I enjoyed the added scenes chronicaling the police investigation into the rash of murders following Dandridge's arrival, his added backstory--like most villian backstories--robs him of mystery and edge.

Worst of all the writing itself underwhelms, with lazy sentences like this:

All that said, for Fright Night fans, the audio book makes it worthwhile. Chris Sarandon, who played Dandridge in the film, narrates, and the thrill of hearing him read the story overshadows the novel's faults. This despite the glaring reddubs in the narration where, for a sentence or two, Sarandon seems to be speaking from an echo chamber, evidence said redubs were recorded in a different location or with different equipment.

Dissappointing, yes, but nothing Fright Night fans can't overcome.
