Nora's on her way to visit her friend's cabin. It's late and she gets a pair of flats on a darkened country road. Spotting lights, she ventures to a nearby cabin, hoping to use the phone. There she meets Steve, an artist who specializes in macabre paintings.

But Steve's got a secret, his grotesque paintings are based on true events. The models are women he stranded, just like Nora. But Nora isn't there to pose for a painting. No, Steve's discovered something monstrous in Lake Arkham behind his cabin. Something he wants to paint. The trouble is, his subject won't reveal itself without an offering. So Nora's going to be the bait.

Nice Lovecraftian twist. Made me wish Laymon had fleshed this out into something bigger.
