Though most of tales are EC Comics style setups for twist endings, they're well executed, and the others such as the opening Jerusalem's Lot, which adapts Stoker's The Lair of the White Worm, and the closing, The Woman in the Room, about a man's struggle to deal with his cancer-ridden mother's slow death, are outstanding, the latter especially so given that we now know that it's essentially an autobiographical story.
