Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation is so engrained in popular culture that new readers will likely be surprised that the Jack in the novel never utters the famous “Here’s Johnny!” line. </p>

<p>The movie and book both share a similar plot. Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He moves in with his wife and five-year-old son just as the last of the hotel staff are leaving for the off-season. Soon, the snow comes, blocking the roads and isolating the hotel. Cut off from the outside world, Jack goes crazy and turns against his family in a murderous rage.</p>

<p>Where the book and the film differ is in their presentation of the supernatural. King makes it clear that the hotel is haunted by a malevolent presence bent on claiming Jack’s son Danny for it’s own ends. It’s not clear why the Overlook wants Danny, but it has something to do with Danny’s burgeoning telepathy. Kubrick’s film invites us to consider that its supernatural elements are all in the character’s minds and that Jack simply cracks up.</p>

<p>They’re both entertaining stories, but Kubrick’s version is more insightful. Because Kubrick saw what it took King years to see; that in Jack Torrance, Stephen King was writing himself.</p>

<p>Consider Jack Torrance: a broke, alcoholic playwright struggling to live up to his early successes and provide for his family. 
Now consider King: an alcoholic novelist with two young children to support. His first two novels were wildly successful, but it wasn’t that long ago that he was writing in the laundry room of the trailer his family called home while scraping to come up with money to buy medicine for his infant child.</p>

<p>Knowing this, is it any wonder that King hated Kubrick’s version? For Kubrick, the supernatural elements of the story were just a way for Jack to deflect responsibility away from himself. Jack was a monster before he ever set foot in the Overlook. For King, Jack was a flawed man who fell victim to an insurmountable force of evil. King cares about Jack, even after Jack succumbs to his demons. </p>

<p>King struggled with alcoholism while writing <em>The Shining</em>.  He also had two young children at the time. Knowing that, is it a stretch to read this as a confession of an alcoholic parent? Perhaps. But it&rsquo;s no less effective.</p>

<p>Consider that Jack is a writer struggling to live up to his early promise. <em>The Shining</em> was King’s third book after the wildly successful <em>Carrie</em> and <em>’Salems Lost</em>. </p>

<p>The Torrance’s are hurting financially. We know that King wrote <em>Carrie</em> at night in the laundry room of the trailer he was living in with his wife and first child while struggling to make ends meet. Lastly, Jack is an alcoholic and we now know that King struggled with alcoholism until the late 1980s. </p>

<p>King struggled with alcoholism while writing <em>The Shining</em>.  He also had two young children at the time. Knowing that, is it a stretch to read this as a confession of an alcoholic parent? Perhaps. But it&rsquo;s no less effective.</p>

<p><em>The Shining</em> works because we sympathize with Jack. King writes him not as a bad man, but a flawed one. Jack is an alcoholic who hasn’t had a drink in five months. Jack has a bear of a temper. He lost his teaching job back in Vermont after his assaulting one of the students. He struggles to provide for his family. He struggles not to drink. He worries that he’s no better than his own drunken, abusive old man. </p>

<p>But the book’s strength is that we see these things through the eyes of a five-year-old boy.  We feel Danny’s confusion and fear as Jack succumbs to his inner demons and becomes a monster. For a young child, or the child in each of us, could anything be more terrifying?</p>

<p>When they arrive, Danny senses something evil in the hotel. He wants to tell his parents but he also senses that his father needs this job and doesn&rsquo;t want to spoil things. As winter unfolds and the snow moves in, Danny begins having visions of the more gruesome events in the hotel&rsquo;s past.</p>

<p>In <em>The Shining</em>, Jack Torrance agrees to serve as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. Unbeknownst to Jack and his wife, their five-year-old son Danny is a burgeoning psychic. </p>

<p>He moves in with his wife and five-year-old son Danny.</p>

<p><em>The Shining</em> is a haunted house story. The house in this case happens to be a hotel. It’s suitably menacing. Bad things happen there. You wouldn’t want to visit.</p>

<p>Jack Torrance is a writer struggling to live up to the promise of his early work. Jack is also an abusive alcoholic whose temper cost him his teaching job at a Vermont prep after he assaulted a student. </p>

<p><em>The Shining</em> sees Jack Torrance uproot his wife and five-year-old son from Vermont to Colorado to serve as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Jack lost his teaching job at a Vermont prep school after assaulting a student.</p>

<p>Jack Torrance is a once-promising writer who accepts a job as winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. </p>

<p>Never mind that, during the winter months, the heavy snowfall cuts the Overlook off from the outside world for weeks or even months at a time. Jack thinks the isolation will allow him to focus on his writing. </p>

<p>Never mind that it means uprooting his wife and five-year-old son across the country to the Colorado Rockies, the Torrance’s are broke and Jack has burned a lot of bridges. </p>

<p>Never mind that the previous caretaker went mad and killed his family before committing suicide, Jack lost his teaching job at a Vermont prep school after assaulting a student. </p>

<p>Jack and his wife don&rsquo;t know it, but their son Danny is a burgeoning telepath. When they arrive, Danny senses something evil in the hotel.

<p>The Overlook wants Danny for his psychic abilities, but Danny proves resistant to the hotel&rsquo;s influence. So the hotel goes to work on Jack. Bit by bit, the Overlook breaks him down until it possesses him completely, turning him against his family in a murderous rage.</p>
