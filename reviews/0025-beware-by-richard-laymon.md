Lacey is a reporter for the local paper in her small home town of Oasis, Arizona. A series of events sees her sexually assaulted held hostage by an invisible assailant who seems to be someone from her past. Lacey makes an ingenious escape and skips town to hide out in a resort hotel.

There she meets Scott an author of pulp-detective stories. He susses out pretty quickly that's she's on the run and agrees to help her, even if he doesn't believe her story about the invisible assailant. 

Soon, her attacker has found her and Lacey and Scott are on the run for their lives through the corridors of the hotel. Not before Scott has time to call in reinforcements however. Matt Dukane is a highly skilled mercenary and the source of Scott's lurid tales. 

The three soon realize they're under attack from a mysterious supernatural cult, on that's already infitrated all levels of society and will stop at nothing until they're all dead.

_Beware_ is a nice return to the supernatural for Laymon. He throws us into Lacey's situation floors the accelerator. We never get the full picture regarding the cult, just enough information to give us an idea of the stakes in play. Dukane is an admitted pulp creation but that doesn't mean he's not fun. Yes, Laymon does subject Lacey to repeated sexual assaults, but he also refuses to let that define her character. She may be victimized, but she's not a victim. For as much as his novels get labeled as masoginistic, it's astounding how so many miss this point. 

Like everything from Laymon thus far, this is pure pulp. An easy, fast-read that keeps hoping the characters survive another turn of the page.
