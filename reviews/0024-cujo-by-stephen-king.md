_Cujo_ follows the Trenton family. Father Vic is an ad-man who's forced to travel to New York for a couple of weeks in last-ditch effort to save his firm, leaving mother Donna and son Tad at home. Donna's been having car trouble and Vic urges her to take her car to Joe Camber, a mechanic who lives on the outskirts of town. Donna and Tad make the journey only to have the car die on them in Joe Camber's driveway, where they're then terrorized by the Camber's 200lb St. Bernard, Cujo, who's gone rabid.

I first read _Cujo_ when I was thirteen or fourteen. I went in expecting some kind of possessed supernatural monster and when Cujo turned out to be just a rabid dog, I felt let down. Reading it now, I can see that in keeping it grounded, King didn't have to do a big reveal, didn't have to bring in the 'fist of god' to allow the hero to triumph, instead, with a real monster he could delivery a real ending, his best one so far.

Not that King doesn't intone that there are supernatural goings on. The only plot King has to worry about is getting Donna and Tad to the Camber's. The series of circumstances that allow this to happen are substantial--King's characters say as much on more than one occasion--but we buy it because in King's hands the town itself becomes a central character, one with, lets say, an 'inclination' toward evil. If one were to look at the infant mortality rate across Maine, I suspect it would be a point or so higher in Castle Rock. The kind of thing that would be dismissed as part of the 'margin for error' in the sampling, but we know better. King makes it clear that Cujo isn't a bad dog, just one unfortunate enough to go crazy due to rabies, which he got because, well, that's what Castle Rock does to good things.

Vic is a successful advertising executive and family man facing the collapse of his firm and marriage. Donna is a doting mother carrying on an affair with Steve Kemp, an amiable furniture stripper and tennis pro with a violent temper. Joe Camber is an honest mechanic and mean drunk well his way to being an alcoholic. Charity is Joe's dutiful wife who dreams of running away with the lottery money she's secretly won. Nearly every adult character in the book has a secret. Free from plot, King dives deep into the hidden side of bucolic small-town life. 

It's a great meditation on the horrors of aging and parenthood and all the things that I simply couldn't hope to relate to in the eighth grade. And did I mention that none of the characters are writers?
