Though published in 2022, Philip Fracassi wrote Don't Let Them Get You Down in Y, early in his career. Though flawed, it hints at Fracassi's burgeoning talent.

The story follows X, a Y, who's fallen into a spiraling depression since his wife's death X years prior.

But this proves the novel's biggest problem. Fracassi tells us everything. X's raw inner-monologue lends his character an empathetic vulnerability, but limits Facassi's ability to propel the narrative through action or dialog. Instead, we have X telling us how he feels.

Fracassi breaks out of this cage for the novel's standout sequence. In a misguided effort to socialize, X agrees to a night out with a coworker, the unstable Z. Consider how Fracassi sets the stage:

Naceant here, he'd perfect this kind of mounting dread in his later works.
