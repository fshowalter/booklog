* ### a great book ###
![5 stars](5-stars.svg) I loved it. A must-read. A perfect or nearly perfect book. These are the book I recommend to everyone. This is a hard rating to earn.

* ### a good book ###
![4 stars](4-stars.svg) I really liked it. Unless you hate the genre or author, you should read it. These are the books I recommend to most folks. They may not resonate like the 5-star selections, but they don’t disappoint either.

* ### an okay book ###
![3 stars](3-stars.svg) I liked it. I wouldn’t recommend it, but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend _against_ it either. Many a bestseller falls into this category.

* ### a bad book ###
![2 stars](2-stars.svg) I didn’t like it. Unless you have a deep-seeded love for the genre or author, avoid it. It wasn’t completely awful, but if I finished it, I felt burned.

* ### an awful or abandoned book ###
![1 star](1-star.svg) I likely abandoned it. If not, everyone involved should apologize. Also a hard rating to earn. When reading a 1-star review, remember: I read them so you don’t have to.
